--AMO               False,0         Number of Cube Files to generate for Alpha MOs starting from the value of "--start". The Sign of the Value corresponds to ascending or descending from the Starting State.
--AStart            False,nan                Starting State for the Calculation of Alpha MO Cube Files. Value can be either the MO Number of HOMO/LUMO+x. HOMO and LUMO are converted to the MO Number accordingly.
--BMO               False,0        Number of Cube Files to generate for Beta MOs starting from the value of "--start". The Sign of the Value corresponds to ascending or descending from the Starting State.
--BStart            False,nan                Starting State for the Calculation of Beta MO Cube Files. Value can be either the MO Number of HOMO/LUMO+x. HOMO and LUMO are converted to the MO Number accordingly.
--MO                True,1         Number of Cube Files to generate starting from the value of "--start". The sign of the Value corresponds to ascending or descending from the Starting State.
--procs             True,12        Number of Threads that are used to calculate the Cube Files. Each Calculation takes 2 Threads.
--start             True,HOMO      Starting State for the Calculation of Cube Files. Value can be either the MO Number or HOMO/LUMO+x. HOMO and LUMO are converted to the MO Number accordingly.
